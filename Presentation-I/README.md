Here, we take dataset for a small patch and similate 100 points in a straight line in an arbitrary manner.  

1. We start with the source and find the end.
Now we use the end and backtrack it to the source.

It is so accurate that not only would your mind be just blown away - like literally poof - but also you'll notice how accurate the source points are to the straight line we selected. So these current thingies are pretty accurate right?

Let's use them!
